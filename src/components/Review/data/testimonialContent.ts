    quote: `When I was in my early twenties, I booked an aesthetic procedure abroad after seeing a promotion on social media. I didn't really question whether that treatment was the best solution for my skin concerns — I just went for it. Unfortunately, the practitioner wasn't truly specialized in that technique, and the procedure went wrong. I ended up with burns, irregular skin texture, and pigmentation issues that took me almost three years to fix with multiple corrective treatments.

Beyond the money and time I lost, the emotional toll was enormous. If I had been properly guided — not just toward a treatment, but toward the right expert — none of this would've happened.`,
